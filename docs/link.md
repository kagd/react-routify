# Link

It is highly recommended to use the Link component rather than anchor tags. Page.js applies a global listener to anchor tags and modifies their behavior. This functionality may be removed if it proves to be problematic.

To future-proof your code, please use the Link component rather than anchor tags for intra-app navigation.
